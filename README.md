# This Lessson about props Properties

we need to resue some piece of code/component/templete in react app.

def : props is use to pass the data from parent component to child component.

for this we use props.

let see blogs list is use in different area of project.
we create new component and move that listing templete code to new BlogList component

Now BlogList templete need to be populated but component code is in Home component

first we can paste the code to BlogList component. but by this approch we can not use the same component code.
